# Day 2
Input: a list of "games" with numbers of cubes of different colors drawn from a bag

Part 1: We know that there are a certain number of each cube of each color in the bag. Based on what is shown in the "game", is it possible?

Most of the problem here is parsing the input. Input parsing is a huge part of this event

Part 2: Similar to part 1, but determine the minimum number of cubes of each color the bag must contain to allow the games to be played.

Code only contains part 2 solution
